# About Me

I am currently a software engineer for GoDaddy.com. I also have a background in Linux and Windows server administration. I live in Buckeye, AZ with my beautiful wife Kayla, and my two amazing girls Lydia and Hannah. In my spare time I enjoy creating music, playing games, and spending time with my family.
