I am starting a blog based on what I am currently doing in development and technology. I plan on having a new post at least every week. Head on over to the [about](/about) page for more information about me.

This blog is being created with [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) and hosting on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I wanted to use a bogging framework that used the same technologies that I am currently working with. When I get more well versed in Hexo, ill make a post reviewing it and even possibly a tutorial.

I am welcome to any feedback, hit me up on my twitter [@mattpker](https://twitter.com/mattpker) or use the commenting system.
