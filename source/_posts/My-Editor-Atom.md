Coming from a background in Linux server administration, of course my first editor was Vim. I really like Vim as a basic editor, but when I started programing it really did not fit my needs. I realize that you can highly customize Vim and make it much like "modern" editors of today, this just seemed way to complex for me and I wanted something a bit more user friendly with mouse support.

The editor everyone recommended to me was [Sublime 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/). I enjoyed the look and feel of Sublime, but it still did not seem as user friendly that I hoped. Even so, I decided to go ahead with it as it seemed to be the best option at that time.

I used Sublime 2 as my primary editor for about 2 years. I had it very customized to my liking and I was very confortable with it. So changing editors at this point was not even on my radar.

About 6 months ago I stumbled across [Atom](https://atom.io/), an editor still in beta from GitHub. It was promising an awesome packaging system, theme support, GitHub support baked in, and powered all by NodeJS and web technologies. At the time I was really getting into NodeJS and decided that I wanted to give it a try to see what it was capable of.

Right out of the box Atom blew me away with an amazing packaging system. Within minutes I found a theme and syntax that I liked and all the comparable plugins I was using in Sublime 2. I felt at home with Atom as it was much like Sublime 2 and most the keyboard shortcuts were the same. It wasn't till I started coding in an actual Git project that I realized I would not be going back to Sublime 2. It had built in Git support that I had never seen before, such as lines were colored that had been changed/added/deleted and the same thing with new/changed files/folders in the tree view.

Atom recently released [version 1.0](http://blog.atom.io/2015/06/25/atom-1-0.html) and at this point I would recommend it to everyone. It is extremely stable and they have greatly improved the startup time and speed. I am excited to see what they do next with Atom, hopefully some more great baked in GitHub features and solving the problem of opening very large files (200MB+).
